# Asymgram

**Asymgram** stands for **Asymmetrency Grammar**, a syntactic framework under development that is closely related to dependency grammar. It is currently unpublished and still evolving as a research concept. The framework is designed to support syntactic annotation, manipulation, and structural analysis of dependency-based linguistic data.

The name "AG" is also chosen in honor of the author's favorite esports club: Chengdu AG (All Gamers).

You can import the package as follows:

```python
import asymgram as ag
